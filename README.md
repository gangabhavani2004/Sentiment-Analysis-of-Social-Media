# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Social-Media
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of social media posts using the BERT algorithm to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. It involves data preprocessing, such as cleaning and tokenization, followed by fine-tuning a BERT model for classification. The project's workflow includes preparing the dataset, training the model using provided scripts, and evaluating performance using accuracy and F1 score. Required Python libraries include transformers, torch, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. For usage, datasets are placed in the data/ directory, and scripts are available for training and prediction. The project utilizes resources from the Hugging Face library and is licensed under the MIT License.
